# API Versioning

GAUS APIs are being continuously developed and improved.

That said, following changes to the API are considered backwards-compatible and devices that uses the API should be able to handle them.

 * Adding new endpoints
 * Extending existing endpoint reponses with additional data.
 * Adding additional query parameters for existing endpoints.

If GAUS decide to break the API at some point, GAUS will provide new endpoints and run the old and new endpoint simultaneously, to not interfere with the devices already on the market.
